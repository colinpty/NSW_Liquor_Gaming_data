## How to Install

1. Create a new blank database in Postgres.  
	`CREATE DATABASE nsw_liquor_licences;`

2. Run the code in the **create_nsw_liquor_licences.sql** file to create the table in the database.

3. Run the code in all 6 insert files located in the **Insert_Data** Folder to insert data for each table. *Please note that there are over 100,000 records of data to be inserted which will take time.*
